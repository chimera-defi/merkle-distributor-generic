# Info

This is based on the uniswap merkle distributor with the following changes:

- Change the base to a generic merkle distributor to allow it to be used with more than just erc20
- New TimedClawback contract to allow owner to retrieve unclaimed tokens in the airdrop after a set timeframe
- Add a way to change the merkle root to allow us to reuse the contract
- Add an example implementation that does the same as the original erc20 merkle distributor with the additional clawback and merkle root update functionality
- Update sol to 0.6.12 to allow release on metis if needed
